In this game, two players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Let's dive into how it works:

Rolling the Dice: The active player rolls the dice to get a number between 1 and 6. The number rolled is added to the player's current round score.

Holding Points: The player can choose to hold, which adds the current round score to the player's total score. It then becomes the other player's turn.

Losing Points: If a player rolls a one, their current round score is reset to zero, and it becomes the other player's turn.

Winning the Game: The game continues until one player reaches 100 points. That player wins the game.

Resetting the Game: Players can reset the game at any time, which sets all scores back to zero.
